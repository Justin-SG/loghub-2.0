# LogPub

LogPub is a collection of large-scale annotated datasets for log parsing based on Loghub, proposed by LogPAI.

Based on LogPub, we propose a more comprehensive benchmark of log parsers. The detailed evaluation results could be found at [RQ_experiments](RQs_experiments/README.md) ðŸ”—.

## Datasets download

Please first download the full datasets of LogPub via [Zenodo](). (Under organization, will be available ASAP.)

Then, you need to put these datasets into `full_dataset/` following the format of `2k_dataset`.

## Requirements

Owing to the large scale of the benchmark in the experiments, the requirements of the benchmark of all log parsers are:

- At least 16GB memory.
- At least 100GB storage.
- GPU (for LogPPT and UniParser).

**Installation**

1. Install ```python >= 3.8```
2. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```


## One-Click Results Reproduction

Running the entire benchmark using Logpub datasets requires more than **48 hours** to complete.

Note that if you would like to evaluate your parser, *one can easily put their parsed results following the format as the files shown in `result/`, and run our evluation code.*

## Large-scale benchmarking

If you woud like to re-run all parsers using Logpub, please follow our large-scale benchmarking steps.

### Quick Demo using Drain

We give a demo script to run Drain on both Loghub-2k and LogPub, this will takes about 2-3 hours.

```bash
cd benchmark/
./demo.sh
```

### Evaluation of all 15 parsers

One can follow the steps to evaluate all parsers using Loghub-2k or the proposed Logpub datasets. The overall time cost is more than 48 hours.

- Run all statistic-based log parsers on Loghub-2k

```bash
cd benchmark/
./run_statistic_2k.sh
```

- Run all statistic-based log parsers on LogPub

```bash
cd benchmark/
./run_statistic_full.sh
```

- Run Semantic-based log parsers: LogPPT & UniParser

  Since these methods are quite different with other log parsers, and they requires a GPU to support efficient parsing, we seperate their environments from other log parsers. Please refer to the README file of [LogPPT](benchmark/LogPPT/README.md) or [UniParser](benchmark/UniParser/README.md) to use one-click script to parse and evaluate each log parsers respectively.
